# Space-Shooters
Space shooter is an indie platform arcade themed game that is heavily based on the 60’s space invaders.
To run the game you need the latest version of the Java runtime environment. From there you can simply open the JAR extension folder and it will run. It will also run on Symbian based phones, this includes most phones before 2010 more especially Nokia’s. 
The game works by using, the left, right and space bar. The left and right arrow are responsible for movement in their respective directions while the space bar is responsible for shooting. 
The game is won by shooting all the Alien ships. If the spaceships make their way towards you and make contact you lose the game.
